# Fake Social Media Profile Detection and Reporting  

This project focuses on identifying and reporting **fake social media profiles** using a combination of **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Graph Analysis**.  
The system is designed to enhance online safety by detecting both **bot-driven** and **human-driven** deceptive accounts, and providing an **automated reporting mechanism**.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Hybrid Detection** – Uses profile metadata, textual content, and network structure to classify fake profiles.  
- **Cross-Platform** – Conceptually supports multiple social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn).  
- **Automated Reporting** – Generates reports for flagged accounts, reducing manual intervention.  
- **Lightweight & Scalable** – Designed to work on modest infrastructure without needing Google-scale resources.
